### Welcome to the party 🎉🎉🎉

My name is Ioan Andrei and I'm currently refreshing my Python and Django
I've been away from programming for a long time, but I'm finally ready to get back in the game 😁🙌
I like making websites, especially the frontend side because the browsers are hilariously bad at following even the simplest commands 🤦‍♂️ but the results are usually pretty funny 🤣

Not sure what else to write here so...

<!--
**Ioan93Andrei/Ioan93Andrei** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my JavaScript and remembering basic CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing JS and planning of following with React and possibly Node.js or Express
- ⚡ Fun fact: I took a really long break from programming and now I'm trying to get back in the game. Probably not that funny but my humor is dry like a rock left in the sun.
